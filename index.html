<p>When planning a visit to Dubai, it is essential to understand the various types of visas available for both tourism and work. Each visa category is designed to accommodate different lengths of stay, ensuring that your experience in this vibrant city aligns with your travel or career aspirations. Whether you're looking to explore the stunning attractions and cultural sites as a tourist or seeking professional opportunities in one of the world's most dynamic job markets, there is a visa option tailored for your specific needs.</p>
<p>The price of a single visa for travel to Dubai for up to 14 days is USD 150. If you need to stay between 14 and 30 days, the price is USD 190, and for 30 to 60 days, it is USD 350. The processing time is 5 business days for express visas (if you need an express visa, an additional USD 80 must be added to the prices indicated above) and 7 to 10 business days for a standard visa. All these visas are for a single entry to Dubai. There is also a super express visa that takes 24 business hours and has a supplement of USD 150. All our prices are final. If you enter Dubai twice during your trip, whether for an overnight stay, because you are taking a cruise, or because your flight touches down on the way to and from Dubai or Abu Dhabi, you must apply for a multiple-entry visa.
