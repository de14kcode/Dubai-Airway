<p>When planning a visit to Dubai, it is essential to understand the various types of visas available for both tourism and work. Each visa category is designed to accommodate different lengths of stay, ensuring that your experience in this vibrant city aligns with your travel or career aspirations. Whether you're looking to explore the stunning attractions and cultural sites as a tourist or seeking professional opportunities in one of the world's most dynamic job markets, there is a visa option tailored for your specific needs.</p>
<p>The cost of a single visa for travel to Dubai for up to 14 days is USD 150. Should your stay extend between 14 and 30 days, the fee will be USD 190, and for stays ranging from 30 to 60 days, the price is USD 350.</p>
<p>Please note that the processing time for express visas is 5 business days, and if you require this expedited service, an additional fee of USD 80 will be added to the aforementioned prices.</p> 
<p>Standard visas typically process within 7 to 10 business days. All visas are valid for a single entry to Dubai.</p>

For those needing to enter Dubai multiple times during their journeyâ€”whether for an overnight stay, joining a cruise, or transitâ€”we recommend applying for a multiple-entry visa. 

If you wish to expedite your visa processing even further, a super express visa option is available, which takes just 24 business hours; this service carries a supplementary charge of USD 150. 

We strive to ensure that all our prices are final and transparent. By choosing to purchase your Dubai Travel Visa through Dubai airline, you secure not only a safe and comfortable travel experience but also personalized customer service to enhance your journey. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to assist you in making the most of your trip.</p>
